Kickstarter Video & Text content:

Skit about how to use site, with screenshots - back & forth of Lisa & Michael	writing funny story. Lisa is Hillary Clinton, Michael is Dick Cheney. Marissa Mayer & Ross Levinsohn, NSA & Edward Snowden
Parody of people holding cards with text - Lisa & Michael keep pushing each other offscreen
	Start with Michael holding a meaningful card, then Lisa holding two meaningful cards. "You need sentenceZing because... you'll meet fun & creative people..." Then Michael with sappy cards. "Because of sentenceZing I'm no longer lonely, world hunger has ended..." Lisa slowly inches him offscreen with card that makes fun of Michael's card. "Michael was never lonely... We only gave food to that guy at the bus stop..." (screenshot of us throwing tomatoes at Randy in a suit at a bus stop). Michael inches her offscreen with "I'm with stupid ->" card. Lisa shoves him offscreen with card that says, "I'm taking over." Michael shoves Lisa offscreen & falls on the floor. Offscreen arguing.
