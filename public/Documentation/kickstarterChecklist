Flashy Intro: 1/4 second clips of stories
"Hi. This is Michael. He's my favorite partner who doesn't do stupid things. Michael is Our Future. And that's a good thing.
"And this is Lisa. She says sharing stories on web platforms will change education, employment, and socializing. She's cool for an old lady.
"We're software developers with a passion for stories
"and games. 
"We're SentenceZing." 
Usage: Screencast of Michael starting new story, entering 1st sentence, Michael: "I told Lisa I'm starting a story She's going to join the story, then her sentence will pop up." Lisa's sentence appears (Need to write the sentences in advance). "Now it's my turn." Michael types 3rd sentence. "We keep taking turns..." 10 timelapse sentences appear. "until we decide the story is complete." Type in THE END. Then Lisa does something goofy - puts code into the story?
Testimonials: Ask Jordin, Christine, Hannah, Cary, Peter. Write questions to ask. Use OBS broadcaster software with Skype.
