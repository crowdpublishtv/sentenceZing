INT. LISA'S LIVING ROOM
Michael and Lisa sit in front of the fireplace sipping hot chocolate and reading a book. A display of candles burns in the fireplace. 

        MICHAEL
    Hello. This is SentenceZing fireside chat with Michael and Lisa. 

        LISA
    SentenceZing is a pair-writing web site where you can create a short story with a partner. It helps you share story ideas and you can mentor one another in writing skills.

        MICHAEL
    And you get to see what crazy stuff old friends come up with, or meet new people online.

        LISA
    Michael & I are software engineers who love to share stories. We're creating SentenceZing so you can share your stories too.

        MICHAEL
    Let's hear what others have to say about SentenceZing.


Testimonials: Ask Jordin, Christine, Hannah, Cary, Peter. Write questions to ask. Use OBS broadcaster software with Skype

Questions for Testimonial Video Interviews:
What did you like best about using SentenceZing?
Why might other people want to use the site?
What kind of people would you recommend use the site?


INT. SENTENCEZING HEADQUARTERS (or Lisa's home office)
Michael sits at a desk with his laptop and a Cat in the Hat hat. 

        MICHAEL
    So, how does sentenceZing work? I'll show you. 

Michael motions to the audience to look at his screen.

INT. SCREENSHOT
Home page of sentenceZing.com. Go through all this very quickly. 

        MICHAEL (OS)
    I'll start a story so someone can join it.

Click on New Story.

        MICHAEL (OS)
     Let's call it "We're Doing a Kickstarter Campaign."

Type "We're Doing a Kickstarter Campaign" into Title - time lapse. 

        MICHAEL (OS)
     Let's say it's in the Nonfiction category. One of the future features of SentenceZing is to search by category.

Type "Nonfiction" into Category - time lapse. Click Create Story. The screen changes to allow the first sentence to be typed.

        MICHAEL (OS)
    Now I enter the first sentence of the story.

In time lapse at the speed of reading: Michael types, "The inception with the oracle was thwarted by a snowstorm, trapping the scion inside his bunker." Click the Post button.

INT. SENTENCEZING HEADQUARTERS (or Lisa's home office)
Michael at the desk.

        MICHAEL
    I have to wait for someone to join the story. I can check back in a few hours, or I can phone a friend and ask her to play right now.

Michael calls on his phone.

        MICHAEL 
    Hi. Lisa?

        LISA (OS) 
    Hi Michael.

        MICHAEL 
    Let's play sentenceZing.

        LISA (OS) 
    I'm not answering my phone right now.

Michael looks annoyed.

INT. LIVING ROOM
Lisa sits on the couch with her laptop and phone in front of her while her recorded message plays her voice.

        LISA (OS) 
    Send me a text at the beep and I'll play sentenceZing when I return. *BEEP*

        MICHAEL (OS) 
    Fine, Lisa. I'll send a text.

INT. LISA'S SCREEN
Home page of sentenceZing.com. Lisa clicks on Stories. 

        LISA (OS) 
    There are some stories that need to be joined.

Lisa clicks on Join Story for the "We're Doing a Kickstarter Campaign." 

        LISA (OS) 
    It's my turn to add a sentence to the story.

In time lapse: She types "They waited for the snow to pass. A week later, they entered the cave." and clicks Post.

INT. SENTENCEZING HEADQUARTERS (or Lisa's home office)
Michael is laying his head sideways on the desk with screen in view, bouncing a small ball & catching it.

        MICHAEL (mumbling)
    I know Lisa's phone is on.  

INT. SCREENSHOT
Screen refreshes to show Lisa's new sentence.

        MICHAEL (mumbling OS)
    She's just ignoring me.

INT. SENTENCEZING HEADQUARTERS (or Lisa's home office)
Michael sits up with a jolt.

        MICHAEL
    I got a new sentence! It's my turn.

INT. SCREENSHOT
In time lapse Michael types, "Inside the cave, they found a treasure chest encrusted with rubies and gems." Click Post.

        MICHAEL (OS)
    Now we keep taking turns writing short pieces of the story.

Text: Slithering around the chest was a python. appears onscreen
In time lapse Michael types, "The scion and oracle approached the treasure chest. When they opened it, they found an oculus that revealed a fissure in the cave's floor." Click the Post button.
Text: Then the python ate the treasure chest and disappeared into the rift. appears onscreen.
In time lapse Michael types, "Except that pythons don't eat rubies. The End." Click the Post button.

INT. SENTENCEZING HEADQUARTERS (or Lisa's home office)
Michael looks up from computer.

        MICHAEL
     And that's how to create a sentenceZing story.

Lisa walks in typing on her phone.

        LISA
     Not the end. The python entered the 4th dimension and announced her message to the world. BLOOD. GORE. MURDER. The End. Mwaaaahaaahaha.

INT. SCREENSHOT
The sentence Lisa just said appears onscreen.

INT. SENTENCEZING HEADQUARTERS (or Lisa's home office)
Lisa comes up from behind and gives Michael a hug around his shoulders.

        MICHAEL
    I knew you had your phone on because I could hear it. 

        LISA
    Let's show them our sentenceZing profiles.

        MICHAEL
    Why do you want to show them that?

Lisa sits in the chair next to Michael.

        LISA
    Because I want them to see your cowboy hat.

INT. SCREENSHOT
Michael's profile - cowboy hat picture, So Sentence dog, followers.

        LISA (OS)
    See how popular Michael is. He has 6 followers.

        MICHAEL (OS)
    That's not very popular.

        LISA (OS)
    It's more than anyone else has yet.

        MICHAEL (OS)
    Probably because I've contributed to more stories than anyone else has.

Go to Lisa's profile.

        LISA (OS)
    Maybe. But I've written more total sentences.

        MICHAEL (OS)
    I'm going to vote for one of the stories.

Click on Stories. Page with list of stories appears. Click on title of a story with 0 likes. Shadowbox appears. Click like. Bring arrow toward the X at the bottom of screen. (Press F5.) Shadowbox disappears.

        MICHAEL (OS)
    Look. I have some notifications. 

Click on Notifications dropdown. 

        MICHAEL (OS)
    Must be my turn to add to the story.

Click on whatever story is at the top of the list. 

INT. SENTENCEZING HEADQUARTERS (or Lisa's home office)
Lisa and Michael.

        MICHAEL 
    But I'll add to it later. I'd rather talk about the goals we have for the site.

        LISA
    If our total pledges add up to $1000, we're going to add a messaging feature and improve the design of user profiles and the other pages on the site.

        MICHAEL 
    And if we get over $2000 in pledges, we'll create new game modes and implement some social sharing features.

        LISA 
    But if we get over $4000 in pledges, we'll create a feature so you can order t-shirts with your story printed on the front with a pretty border.

        MICHAEL 
    And if we get over $40 000 in pledges, we'll create a sentenceZing app for Android.





        LISA
    A long time ago, in a place far far away, there lived a bunny.

        MICHAEL
    The bunny morphed into a zombie and ran through the town while everyone used it for target practice.
